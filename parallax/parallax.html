	<h2>SANTORINI</h2>
	<p>
		Glamourous Santorini is deliciously different. Geographical newness is in part to thank. The islandâ€™s popular black volcanic Perissa and Kamari beaches are big draws, as is its arguably most famous Red Beach near Akrotiri (which is the place to go for archaeology buffs). Santorini curves round a giant lagoon in the Cyclades islands, offering stunning views from sky-high towns, eclectic cuisine, lovely galleries, thriving nightlife and excellent wines.

		<h2>MUNNAR</h2>
		<p>
			Munnar is a popular hill-station of Kerala perched at an altitude of 1600 metres in the Western Ghats. Famous for its tea estates, various shades of green, blankets of mist and craggy peaks, Munnar is aptly known as the 'Kashmir of South India'.

Situated on the banks of three rivers- Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru, Munnar is also blessed with natural view-points apart from the tea-plantations. Munnar is divided into Old Munnar, where the tourist information office is, and Munnar, where the bus station and most guest houses are located. The Eravikulam National Park, Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and tea plantations are its major attractions.

		<h2>MALDIVES</h2>
		<p>
			The point of the Maldives is that it is not a single large island but is, instead, a collection of thousands of tiny coral islands. ... Each island is surrounded by a lagoon of shallow water (though the Indian Ocean, with its deep blue water, lies beyond). It is the clearest water you will ever see.
